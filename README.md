## 1. What This Project Shows
- [ ] Problem: (short statement — e.g., "Enterprises lack unified observability across workloads.")
- [ ] Solution: (short statement — e.g., "Deployed PLG stack on AWS EKS using Terraform.")
- [ ] Impact: (short statement — e.g., "Improved incident visibility, reduced MTTR by 40%.")

## 2. How to Use This Template
<ol type="a">
<li> **Deploy once** (small/dev resources) → validate it works.
<li> **Take 2–3 screenshots** (AWS Console, Grafana, AWS Athena/queries, AWS QuickSight charts) and save them in `docs/screenshots/`.
<li> **Add an architecture diagram** to `docs/architecture.png`.d. **Destroy the infra** to avoid charges (`terraform destroy`).
<li> Fill in the sections below (What This Shows, Architecture, Screenshots, Tech Used).
<Li> Link your security docs: [Policy](SECURITY.md) • [Checklist](docs/security-checklist.md).
</ol>

## 3. Architecture
High-level diagram of how services fit together.
NOTE: Replace this image with your diagram.

---

## 4. Screenshots (Proof of Work)
Once the project is deployed, add 2-3 proof screenshots when you deploy it once: 

a. **AWS Console**  
   _Example: EKS cluster deployed_  
   ![EKS Screenshot](docs/screenshots/eks-cluster.png)

b. **Grafana Dashboard / AWS Athena Query / AWS QuickSight Chart**  
   _Example: Cost optimization dashboard_  
   ![Dashboard Screenshot](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

c. **Command Line Output**  
   _Example: Terraform apply success_  
   
---

## 5. Tech Used
Example: AWS Services (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.), Terraform, GitHub Actions, Python  

---

## 6. Cost Note
This project is created on-demand and destroyed after screenshots are taken to avoid AWS charges.
